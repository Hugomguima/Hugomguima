### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I'm a recent graduate of Computer Science at Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto (FEUP) and this repository mainly contains projects performed during my 5 years studying.

My preferred programing language is **Java** and I also have experience with:
- Python
- C
- C++
- C# (Unity)
- JavaScript/TypeScript
- HTML/CSS/PHP (with and without frameworks)

My main areas of interest are Software Engineering (Back-End) and DevOps, but I am open to different IT areas.
